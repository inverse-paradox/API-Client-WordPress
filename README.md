API-Client-WordPress
====================

Report any issues to me directly or through the issue tracker and i'll correct them. 

This does not have a kill switch, just 3 dashboard widgets.

To install:

1. Download ZIP from github and install on site.
2. Go to API Manager and add client's website: http://wiki.inverseparadox.net/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=api_manager
3. Re-arrange the client's dashboard so it looks nice, see inverseparadox.com/wp-admin for example.
4. The cron will pick it up within an hour and display content.
